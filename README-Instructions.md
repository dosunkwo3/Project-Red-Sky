# Project-Red-Sky
Sprint 4:
- Map and markers are interactive. Markers can be clicked to view individual fireball information
- Table displays information about each fireball and can be sorted by clicking on each column heading
- Sorting the table columns may take a few seconds to load due to large amount of data
- Select which filters you would like and then clicking submit
- Date filter won't display correctly if "Hide All" button is clicked before submitting
- Click on charts on the top left to view the a visual representation of the data.

- This application uses nodejs, so inside the console: install any dependencies w/ "npm i", and use "node app" to start the web application at http://localhost:3000/

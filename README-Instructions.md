# Project-Red-Sky
Sprint 2:
Currently, the only functionality of the web application is being able to move around the map. The filters are non-functioning right now.
This application uses nodejs, so inside the console: install any dependencies w/ "npm i", and use "node app" to start the web application at http://localhost:3000/

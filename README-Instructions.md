# Project-Red-Sky
Sprint 3:
- Map and markers are interactive. Markers can be clicked to view individual fireball information
- Table displays information about each fireball and can be sorted by clicking on each column heading
- Filters are currently non-functioning
- This application uses nodejs, so inside the console: install any dependencies w/ "npm i", and use "node app" to start the web application at http://localhost:3000/
